# DM-Code
Code created for the analyzation of the rotation of a galaxy to determine the amount of dark matter 


This was created before I knew that git existed, and code was mostly shared through dropbox. I have since seen the light.

This code was used for the purpose of determining the mass of a Dark Matter Halo surrounding a galaxy. 
This was done by spectroscopically analyzing the red shift of H-alpha regions.
